* Dependencies
- TFM (my TeX Font Metrics library), available in Quicklisp or on
  [[https://github.com/didierverna/tfm][GitHub]].
- You need to have the Latin Modern fonts installed on your machine.

* Portability
The core is portable but there's only a Lispworks/CAPI GUI for now.
I'll gladly accept new GUIs, such as */McClim, ECL/EQL, /etc./

* Quickstart
#+BEGIN_SRC Lisp
;; #### WARNING: this is alpha-grade software.
