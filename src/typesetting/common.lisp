;; #### NOTE: we currently provide two different ways for pinning objects.
;; - The fist one is to use the PINNED class to pin any object. It's useful
;;   when you want to reference a pinned object without actually touching it.
;;   This is what we do in lines, because line items are in fact harray items
;;   (except for whitespaces) and those items can potentially be shared
;;   across different lines.
;; - The second one is to subclass an original class, mixing it in with the
;;   PIN mixin. This comes in handy when no sharing is expected, and this is
;;   what we do with lines becoming pinned lines (by way of change-class) when
;;   a layout is rendered.
;; On the other hand, this might go away some day. Indeed, the distinction
;; between lines and pinned lines only comes from the fact that our algorithms
;; currently don't take the vertical spacing into account when they break the
;; harray. This will probably change in the future.
