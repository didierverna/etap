;; A `lineup' is an object representing the paragraph material ready for
;; typesetting. The actual material is stored into a so-called `harray' (the
;; equivalent of an hlist, in array form).

;; In addition to the harray, the lineup also stores the computation of the
;; break points and theoretical solutions numbers. We associate those numbers
;; with the harray rather than with the hlist because some algorithms have
;; control over the availability of the original break points (e.g. by putting
;; an infinite penalty on hyphenation points).
