;; #### NOTE: with the default text, paragraph width, and all features, there
;; are 66576 paragraph solutions including going through under and overfull
;; lines (21096 without hyphenation). The raw tree of all such solutions has
;; 150860 nodes (48338 without hyphenation). However, once a line stop has
;; been decided, all possible solutions for the next lines remain the same
;; (modulo the rectangular paragraph assumption), however we reached that
;; possible stop. This means that there is a lot of room for re-using
;; branches. And indeed, when sharing nodes, we fall from 150860 to 98 (from
;; 48338 to 83 without hyphenation).

;; If we avoid preventive fulls, that is, if we include only under- and
;; overfull solutions when there is no fit, the number of paragraph solutions
;; falls to 37 (it actually raises up to 61 without hyphenation, all
;; mistfits). The raw tree of all such solutions has only 109 nodes (192
;; without hyphenations). Once shared, the actual number of nodes falls down
;; to 30 (33 without hyphenation).

;; The set of all possible solutions found by an algorithm is represented by a
;; graph rather than a tree, so that storage is saved by sharing nodes. Such a
;; graph is oriented and acyclic. It also has only one root (the beginning of
;; the paragraph), and only one leaf (the end of the paragraph).

;; A graph is represented by a hash table storing edges rather than nodes. The
;; hash table keys are the harray break points (nodes), and each value is a
;; list of edges from that break point (boundaries). The graph construction
;; process is parameterized by an algorithm-specific function collecting the
;; possible boundaries for a line starting at a particular break point. This
;; allows each algorithm to use it's own boundary subclass.

;; Right now, we only have rectangular paragraphs so graph nodes are just
;; break points in the harray (this expresses the fact that however we reach a
;; particular break point has no influence on the subsequent breaking
;; solutions). Later we will need to make them a combination of break point
;; and line number. Graph edges don't need a specific data structure either,
;; as they can be conveniently reified as boundaries. Because of node sharing
;; however, a graph cannot store information specific to a particular path
;; from the beginning to the end of the paragraph. For that, another data
;; structure called a "layout", and containing a list of "lines", also
;; layout-specific, is used.

;; If there's no entry in the hash table for a particular break point, it
;; means that it was never considered as a possibility. If a break point was
;; considered, but eventually found out to be a dead end, the hash table entry
;; will be NIL (meaning that this break point has no outward edges). The only
;; exception to this is the end of paragraph break point, which has a hash
;; table value of T to indicate that it has no outward edges, but it is
;; normal.
