;; This is TeX's algorithm, initially described in Knuth, Donald E.; Plass,
;; Michael F. (1981), "Breaking paragraphs into lines", Software: Practice and
;; Experience, 11 (11): 1119–1184.

;; We provide both a full graph-based version and a dynamic programming
;; optimized one (as the original). These variants reimplement the principles
;; of the algorithm, not its original low-level implementation. This, by the
;; way, may induce some subtle behavioral differences.

;; For example, by choosing the first of the available layouts after sorting
;; them, we're doing the opposite of what TeX does in case of total demerits
;; equality (extremely rare), or when there's no solution and we resort to
;; overfulls, because TeX restores the last deactivated node (so the last seen
;; (im)possibility. We could instead check for multiple equivalent layouts and
;; take the last one. On the other hand, while we're using a hash table in the
;; dynamic programming implementation, we're not doing exactly what TeX does
;; either, so there's no rush. It's still important to keep that in mind
;; however, because that explains while we may end up with different solutions
;; between the graph and the dynamic versions.

;; define *KP-BOP-NODE* below as a special node which is not really a node.
;; The goal is the same: to make the code more readable by limiting
;; special-casing and simplifying stop conditions in loops notably.
;;
;; The structure of the BOP node is as follows:
;; - previous = NIL
;; - (total) demerits = 0
;; - boundary (base class only) with break-point = *BOP*.
;; - the rest is either uninitialized or doesn't matter.
;;
;; Note that we don't use a KP boundary because we can't let the
;; initialization protocol compute any of its properties (there's no actual
;; line here). It doesn't matter because we don't need to access those, except
;; for the fitness-class. However, the fitness-class is retrieved from the
;; hash table key (see below). Also, *BOP* gives us the correct bol index, and
;; no hyphenation so no double hyphen demerits for the first line.
