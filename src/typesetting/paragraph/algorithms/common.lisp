;; ====================
;; Quality measurements
;; ====================

;; #### NOTE: according to #108, TeX clamps badness values to 10000 which is
;; an approximation of 2^13, and called "infinitely bad", but there's in fact
;; more to it than that when the badness function is used in the paragraph
;; breaking algorithm.

;; According to #853 (and this is explained in #851), an "infinitely bad" + 1
;; value is returned for lines which can't shrink enough, knowing that it is
;; strictly prohibited to shrink more than what's available; that is, for a
;; scaling < -1. Note that this includes lines which have no shrinkability at
;; all.

;; According to #852, an "infinitely bad" value is returned for the whole
;; bunch of lines which would require too much stretching (because of the
;; clamping), but this also includes lines which have no stretchability at
;; all.

;; In other words, for reasonable lines, the badness doesn't make a
;; distinction between shrinking and stretching. However, there is a
;; distinction for unreasonable lines. First of all, the definition of
;; "unreasonable" is different for stretching and shrinking (see the 2
;; paragraphs above). And then, the badness is different for unreasonably
;; shrunk and unreasonably stretched lines.

;; In fact, it seems that TeX uses this distinction only to decide whether or
;; not to deactivate a node (again, as explained in #851). On the other hand,
;; in our implementation, we look at the scaling instead of the badness to
;; make that decision. So it turns out that we can get rid of the clamping
;; altogether. Note also that the tolerance calibration in our implementation
;; turns 10000 into +∞, so we 'll indeed get the same effect as in TeX (cf.
;; #828), that is, to accept arbitrarily bad lines.

;; Consequently, our version of badness below returns +∞ for strictly
;; prohibited scaling (i.e. no scaling available, or negative below -1) and a
;; numerical positive value otherwise.

;; #### TODO: we could generalize the notion of badness to allow /some/
;; overshrinking, possibly with an exponential cost (at least it should be
;; much more important than for stretching). Maybe one difficulty would be
;; that if we want to switch to +∞ when there is no more space between words,
;; the badness computation would then depend on the glue's natural width.

;; #### TODO: we could sign the badness (like the scaling) in order to keep
;; track of whether we're stretching or shrinking.
