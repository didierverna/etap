;; This algorithm uses only the normal, fixed, inter-word spacing. Lines are
;; created sequentially, without look-ahead or backtracking: there are no
;; paragraph-wide considerations.

;; The "Underfull" fallback only allows underfull lines (unless there is no
;; choice). The "Overfull" one does the opposite. The "Anyfull" one normally
;; selects the solution that is the closest to the paragraph's width, whether
;; underfull or overfull. The behavior of these fallbacks is further modulated
;; by the options described below.

;; The "Width Offset" option affects how the Anyfull fallback computes the
;; proximity of a solution to the paragraph's width. When non-zero, it
;; virtually decreases the paragraph's width when doing comparisons, so that
;; underfulls appear less underfull, and overfulls appear more overfull. In
;; other words, the larger the offset, the fewer allowed overfulls.

;; When the "Avoid Hyphens" option is checked, line solutions without
;; hyphenation are preferred when there is a choice. This option takes
;; precedence over the Prefer Overfulls one (see below).

;; In the Anyfull fallback, when the underfull and overfull line solutions are
;; equally distant from the paragraph's width (modulo the offset), and after
;; the Avoid Hyphens option has been taken into account, the underfull one is
;; chosen, unless the "Prefer Overfulls" option is checked.

;; Even though the inter-word spacing is fixed, there is a difference between
;; the justified disposition and the flush left one, although the chance of
;; actually witnessing it should be extremely thin.
;; In justified disposition, getting as close to the paragraph's width (modulo
;; the offset) takes precedence. Thus, the options apply only when there is no
;; fit, and two solutions (one underfull and one overfull) are equally bad.
;; In the ragged dispositions, we care less about the paragraph's width, so
;; the options take precedence. For example, if the Avoid Hyphens option is
;; checked, a word boundary will always be preferred to a hyphen boundary,
;; even if it's farther away from the paragraph's width.

;; Finally, note that because the inter-word spacing is fixed, the
;; "Overstretch" and "Overshrink" options have no effect.


;; #### TODO: the Width Offset idea is but one possibility for modulating the
;; decision between under and overfulls. There are many other ideas that we
;; could implement to further tune the results. Here are two of them.
;;
;; 1. We could consider that hyphens (and why not punctuation !) use less ink
;;    than letters, so at the same distance from the paragraph's width,
;;    overfulls appear less overfull than with letters, and conversely
;;    underfulls appear more underfull than with letters. So this could also
;;    be used as some kind of offset.
;; 2. We could want raggedness thresholds. Well, not exactly since there's no
;;    paragraph-wide considerations, but at least, we could want to minimize
;;    the distance to the paragraph's width, so that for example, even when
;;    the Avoid Hyphens option is checked, a hyphen solution would still be
;;    preferred to a word one if the later really is too far away.
