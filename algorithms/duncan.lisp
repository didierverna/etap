;; This is the Duncan algorithm from: C.J. Duncan, J. Eve, L. Molyneux, E.S.
;; Page, and Margaret G. Robson, Printing Technology 7, 133-151 (1963).

;; I don't have the article, but the Knuth-Plass paper gives a description of
;; it. It searches for an acceptable breaking solution (that is, with
;; adjustment ratios, that I call lineup-scales <= 1 in abs), while minimizing
;; hyphenation. What I don't really know however is how it chooses the final
;; solution when there is several possibilities.

;; #### FIXME: I don't know if Duncan is restricted to the Justified
;; #### disposition, or if it does something for the ragged ones.
